# VERNACULAR.IO ASSIGNMENT

This assignment is hosted on gh-pages and is available on (https://adhijain04.github.io/vernacular-assignment/)

## Experience
The assignment question was absolutely clear to me. I didn't face any issues in understanding the flow or the required functionality.

I didn't had to assume any thing, everything was pretty clear to me, rest MDN docs was very helpful.

Though this was my first time working on CANVAS API, but my experience with DOM manipulation helped me to achieve some functionalities in time, as i was working on this assignment during office hours.

If I had some experience in CANVAS, I would've completed all the functionalities, as the code for "bezierCurveTo" is commented because i ran out of time.

Learned a lot about the difference between DOM and CANVAS, might build one game using CANVAS api in future.

## The Interface
The interface includes :-
1. Header component
2. Canvas component(draggable, zoomable)
    2.1. Left menu bar (for adding different nodes on the canvas)
    2.2. Right side bar (opens for every node and contains an input box.)
    2.3. Nodes(draggable)

## Usage
1. Use mouse wheel / 2 fingers scroll for zoom in/out on the canvas
2. Double click on the canvas to drag it (canvas is surrounded by a red border to indicate the end of the canvas).
3. Double Click on the node to drag it.
    3.1. on single click it will show a border around the selected node.
    3.2. while dragging the border persists until the node is dropped.
    3.3. clicking on the node will simultaneously open the right side bar also.

## Remaining Functionalities
1. Connections between the node (was trying to implement doubly-linkedlists concept to achieve the connections flow btw the nodes.)
2. Delete/Archive and recover the node from archived list (this was a bit difficult in the given time as i wasn't aware that => we have to calculate the coordinates of the shape to assign functionality to it, needed a little more time to implement this).
3. Save the current progress.
